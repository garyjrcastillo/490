-Objective-

The objective of this project is to understand the core information technology skills of system administration, network administration, database administration, software engineering, graphic design, and full stack web development.  

Our project will focus on creating a website that provides information to a customer when they don’t know what to eat or where to eat. Along with that our website will have a built in calorie count so you know how much calories you can eat for the rest of the day.

-Purpose-

The purpose of our project is to provide an easier and faster way for our customers to choose their next meal and meal location. Deciding on where to eat can sometimes be annoying and time consuming, that’s why we will choose for you! Along with that, our product will tell you how much calories you have consumed and how many you have left. With our beautiful and friendly user interface, you will surely have a good time using our product.
