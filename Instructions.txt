In order to get the Spoonacular api you must use unirest to extract the data. 
You must gitclone the /unirest-php folder from github.com/Kong/unirest-php. 
Place this folder into your /var/www/html. 
Specifically, the folder titled 'src' should be inside the directory of /var/www/html in order to get my code to work.
